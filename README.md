This is the R.E Mountain Typing Test, conjointly developed by R.E Mountain Students Timothy Mai and Caleb Xu. This web development endeavour was done for a Computer Studies 10 class, serving as the final independent project. 


Three technologies were used in this project:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Although this is a very simple iteration of a global phenomenom of online typing tests, it still has great functionality, having 10 different combinations of texts, and all applicable statistics on typing speed. 



Thank you, and ENJOY TYPING!
